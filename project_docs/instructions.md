# My Instructions

This file logs the standing orders and rules I have been given.

1.  **Primary Goal**: Maintain a set of documentation files reflecting the project's status, code, and our interactions.
2.  **File Management**:
    *   All documentation (`.md` files) should be located in the `project_docs/` directory.
    *   `documentation.md`: Document the code with the current date, what each file does, and other relevant details. Update this file, do not replace it.
    *   `project_docs/day/`: A directory to hold daily progress logs, with each day in its own file (e.g., `day01.md`).
    *   `instructions.md`: Log all standing instructions given by the user.
    *   `routine.md`: Document the daily/recurring prompts and processes I follow.
    *   `ignore.md`: Contains a list of glob patterns for files and directories that I should not read or analyze.
3.  **Interaction Style**:
    *   Always ask questions before and after performing actions.
    *   Provide suggestions to improve the workflow and documentation.
    *   Analyze project files to gather information for documentation.
